% By directly measuring the distance between the peaks in the waveform, we
% found an average difference of 233 samples, which is 4.85ms. This is very
% close to the 5ms found in 2.3.2: a difference of only 6Hz.

%% 2.3.4)
% By measuring the distances between peaks in the time domain plot, I was
% able to find a very accurate value for the fundamental period during
% that very small amount of time. By instead finding the fundamental
% frequency from the frequency domain plot, I could only find what seemed
% to be the middle of the darkest line, which may have made the measurement
% less accurate, however, the frequency domain gave a much better idea of
% what the average frequency over a large amount
