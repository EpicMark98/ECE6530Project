%% 2.2.1f)
% The amplitude at 100Hz is 50.78. The amplitude at 300Hz is 5.66. The
% ratio between these two is 0.111.

%% 2.2.2a)
% Decibels works by taking the input number, taking the log-base-10 of 
% it and multiplying it by 20. 20*log10(2) = 6.0206. Similarly, because 
% of how the log function works, 20*log10(0.5) = -6.0206. Therefore, a
% difference of 6dB is about a ratio of a factor of 2.

%% 2.2.2b)
% The change between each coefficient is that k increases by 2, 
% therefore the ratio between two non-zero coefficients is
% (-2/(pi^2*k^2))/(-2/(pi^2*(k+2)^2)) which simplifies to ((k+2)^2)/k^2.
% When taking the log of this value when converting to dB, it can be
% further simplified to 2*dB((k+2)/k), which shows that the difference 
% is dependent only on k.
% 
%  Difference between |a_1| and |a_3| = 19.08 dB

%% 2.2.2c)
% We can replace k and k+2 with any valid values to find the difference 
% between any two coefficients. The difference between a_15 and a_1 is 
% 40*log10(15/1) = 47.04.

%
%  a_1 = 0 dB  a_3 = -19.08 dB
%
% Before, when we were measuring amplitude, we found that a_1 had an 
% amplitude of 50.78 and a_3 had an amplitude of 5.66. The reason that a_1
% becomes 0 dB is that decibels are a relative scale, so 0 is arbitrarily
% chosen. In this case, the highest amplitude (50.78) is set as 0 and 
% everything else is relative to that (i.e. 20log10(5.66/50.78) = -19.08).
